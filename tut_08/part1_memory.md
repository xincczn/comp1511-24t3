Stack Allocation Advantages:
- **Speed**: Faster than heap allocation due to simple pointer manipulation and no complex memory management.
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Memory automatically de-allocated when out of scope, ensuring predictable memory management.

Stack Allocation Disadvantages:
- **Limited Size**: Bound by OS, risking stack overflow errors with excessive memory allocation.
- **Static Allocation**: Size of stack-allocated variables must be known at compile-time, hindering dynamic or large data structure allocation.

Heap Allocation Advantages:
- **Dynamic Memory**: Allows dynamic memory allocation at runtime for changing memory requirements.
- **Flexible Management**: Enables resizable data structures through dynamic allocation and deallocation.
- **Large Memory Space**: Offers more memory space compared to the stack, accommodating large data structures.

Heap Allocation Disadvantages:
- **Manual Memory Management**: Requires explicit de-allocation to prevent leaks, leading to issues like fragmentation or dangling pointers.
- **Slower Performance**: Involves more overhead due to memory management operations, impacting performance.
- **Fragmentation**: Frequent allocation/de-allocation may cause memory fragmentation, reducing overall efficiency.
